# Intro

Greetings and welcome to my website.  
I am currently a doctoral candidate at Syracuse University, New York, specializing in the application of sophisticated machine learning tools for the optimization of building-level control and energy conservation. My research extends to study the large-scale human mobility data at the urban level. This allows me to capture the dynamics of city life and gain a deeper understanding of human behaviors within urban environments.  
Thank you for visiting my site. I look forward to sharing my work and insights with you.
