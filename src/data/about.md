# Intro

Greetings and welcome to my website.  
As a Ph.D. Candidate at Syracuse University, I specialize in leveraging advanced machine learning tools to optimize and simulate HVAC control systems at the building level. My expertise extends to working with urban-scale human mobility data, enabling me to capture and analyze the dynamics of urban environments and understand human behaviors at the city level.  
Thank you for visiting my site. I look forward to sharing my work and insights with you.
